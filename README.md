# angular_products_pages

 rewrite the index.html page and the links to the products should be created
automatically (one link for each product we have in the data.json file) â€“ the products do not have images in this case.
Once the user clicks on one of those links.
Add the navigation buttons (> and <) â€“ if you want to include them thatâ€™s ok but not necessary. 
You will
be using the minified versions of angular.js and angular-route.js that you will also find in the Homework folder.
The data for your application should come from the prod.json file.
